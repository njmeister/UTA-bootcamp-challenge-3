# UTA Coding Bootcamp Challenge 3

## Description

This is my submission for the third challenge in the UTA/EdX Coding Bootcamp. The goal of this challenge was to create a password generator with javascript.
The website prompts you to choose a number of characters between 8 and 128 and asks which character types to include from the list of Lowercase Letters, Uppercase Letters, Digits, and Special Characters.
The program then outputs a string of the inputted length made of the specified character types selected.

## Installation

N/A



## Usage
The website prompts you to choose a number of characters between 8 and 128 and asks which character types to include from the list of Lowercase Letters, Uppercase Letters, Digits, and Special Characters.
The program then outputs a string of the inputted length made of the specified character types selected. If the number entered does not fall between 8 and 128 or no categories are selected, an error alert is instead displayed.



## Credits

The code to shuffle the characters (lines 87-96) comes from
